Time Log:

	Week 1: Started mocking up the UI and design of the page. I want a fairly basic looking website while presenting the product well. Also working on getting the website phone responsive.

	Week 2: Currently have the website up and hosted on aaronmeyer.getforge.io as a holder website so I can test it on my phone and multiple devices. I have been able to get the website fully responsive and functional with any device.

	Week 3: Working on getting the site implemented into my git project. I want to start cutting down all of the extra vendor files that are tied to my site as well. 

Plan:

	Week 1-3: Get the visual and front end basic portion completed and get the page ready for testing with the services I will be adding.

	Week 3-5: Add a database to the site and add login screens so customers can subscribe. I also want to add paypal functionality to the site.
